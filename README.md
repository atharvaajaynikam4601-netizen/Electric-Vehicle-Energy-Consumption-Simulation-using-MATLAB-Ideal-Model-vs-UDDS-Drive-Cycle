# EV Powertrain Dynamics, Battery Electrical-Thermal Modeling, and SOC Estimation using Kalman Filter under the UDDS Drive Cycle in MATLAB

## Abstract

This project presents a physics-based simulation of a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) powertrain implemented entirely in **MATLAB**, using the **EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS)** as the driving input.

The simulation integrates multiple subsystems of an electric vehicle including:

- Vehicle longitudinal dynamics
- Motor torque–speed constraints
- Drivetrain efficiency losses
- Regenerative braking
- Battery electrical behavior
- Battery thermal dynamics
- State of Charge (SOC) estimation using a Kalman Filter

Unlike simplified EV energy models, this implementation captures **realistic hardware constraints** of electric vehicles, including traction motor limits, internal battery losses, accessory loads, and regenerative braking effectiveness.

The model provides system-level insight into **energy flow from the wheels to the battery**, allowing evaluation of **vehicle efficiency, thermal behavior, power demand, and range estimation** under a real driving cycle.

# 3 Mathematical Modeling

## 3.1 Vehicle Longitudinal Dynamics

The required traction force is calculated as:


F_total = F_rr + F_aero + F_acc + F_rg


Where:

Rolling Resistance


F_rr = m · g · C_rr


Aerodynamic Drag


F_aero = 0.5 · ρ · C_d · A · v²


Acceleration Force


F_acc = m_eq · a


Equivalent vehicle mass including drivetrain rotational inertia:


m_eq = m (1 + δ)


This accounts for the **rotational inertia of wheels, gears and shafts**.

---

## 3.2 Wheel Mechanical Power

The mechanical power required at the wheel is calculated as:


P_wheel = F_total × v


Tire losses are incorporated using a tire efficiency factor.

---

## 3.3 Motor Torque-Speed Constraint

Electric traction motors operate in two distinct regions.

### Constant Torque Region


T = T_max


### Constant Power Region (Field Weakening)


T = P_max / ω


The base speed separating these regions is


ω_base = P_max / T_max


This logic is implemented using conditional control logic in MATLAB.

---

## 3.4 Motor Efficiency Model

Motor efficiency varies with operating point. Normalized parameters are defined as:


Tn = T / T_max
ωn = ω / ω_max


Efficiency is approximated using a quadratic loss model.

Typical operating ranges:

Drive efficiency


0.75 ≤ η_drive ≤ 0.92


Regenerative braking efficiency


0.55 ≤ η_regen ≤ 0.80


---

## 3.5 Regenerative Braking

During deceleration phases the electric motor operates as a generator.

Recovered power is limited by:

- Maximum regenerative torque
- Battery charging power
- Minimum vehicle speed

Regenerative braking is disabled below


v < 1.5 m/s


to represent **back-EMF limitations of traction motors**.

---

## 3.6 Battery Electrical Model

Battery current is computed as:


I_batt = P_batt / V_nom


Terminal voltage is modeled using internal resistance:


V_batt = V_oc − I_batt · R_internal


The open-circuit voltage is obtained from an **SOC-OCV lookup table** using interpolation.

---

## 3.7 Battery Thermal Model

Battery thermal behavior is modeled using a lumped thermal network.

Heat generation


Q = I² · R_internal


Cooling heat transfer


Q_cooling = (T_batt − T_amb) / R_th


Temperature dynamics


dT/dt = (Q − Q_cooling) / C_th


This allows monitoring of **battery thermal safety limits** during operation.

---

## 3.8 State of Charge Model

SOC is updated based on energy consumption.


SOC(k) = SOC(k−1) − E_step / Battery Capacity


SOC is constrained within physical limits:


0 ≤ SOC ≤ 1


---

## 3.9 SOC Estimation using Kalman Filter

A simplified Kalman Filter is implemented to estimate SOC using noisy voltage measurements.

Prediction step:


SOC_pred = SOC_prev − (I × dt) / Capacity


Update step:


SOC_est = SOC_pred + K (V_meas − V_pred)


This approximates **real Battery Management System (BMS) SOC estimation algorithms** used in electric vehicles.
